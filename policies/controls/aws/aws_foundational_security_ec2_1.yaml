Title: "1 Amazon EBS snapshots should not be public, determined by the ability to be restorable by anyone"
Description: "Amazon EBS snapshots should not be public, determined by the ability to be restorable by anyone. EBS snapshots are used to back up the data on your EBS volumes to Amazon S3 at a specific point in time. You can use the snapshots to restore previous states of EBS volumes. It is rarely acceptable to share a snapshot with the public. Typically the decision to share a snapshot publicly was made in error or without a complete understanding of the implications. This check helps ensure that all such sharing was fully planned and intentional."
