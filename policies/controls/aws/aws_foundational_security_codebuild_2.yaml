Title: 2 CodeBuild project environment variables should not contain clear text credentials
Description: This control checks whether the project contains the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. Authentication credentials AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY should never be stored in clear text, as this could lead to unintended data exposure and unauthorized access.
