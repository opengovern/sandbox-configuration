Title: 3 Classic Load Balancer listeners should be configured with HTTPS or TLS termination
Description: This control checks whether your Classic Load Balancer listeners are configured with HTTPS or TLS protocol for front-end (client to load balancer) connections. The control is applicable if a Classic Load Balancer has listeners. If your Classic Load Balancer does not have a listener configured, then the control does not report any findings. The control passes if the Classic Load Balancer listeners are configured with TLS or HTTPS for front-end connections. The control fails if the listener is not configured with TLS or HTTPS for front-end connections.
