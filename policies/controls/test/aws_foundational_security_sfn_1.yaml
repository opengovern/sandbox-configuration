Title: 1 Step Functions state machines should have logging turned on
Description: This controls checks whether an AWS Step Functions state machine has
  logging turned on. The control fails if a state machine doesn't have logging turned
  on. If you provide a custom value for the logLevel parameter, the control passes
  only if the state machine has the specified logging level turned on.
