Title: 1.6 Ensure hardware MFA is enabled for the 'root' user account
Description: The 'root' user account is the most privileged user in an AWS account.
  MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA
  enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be prompted for their
  user name and password as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA
  device. For Level 2, it is recommended that the root user account be protected with
  a hardware MFA.
