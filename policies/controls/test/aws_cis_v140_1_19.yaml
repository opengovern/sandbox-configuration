Title: 1.19 Ensure that all the expired SSL/TLS certificates stored in AWS IAM are
  removed
Description: To enable HTTPS connections to your website or application in AWS, you
  need an SSL/TLS server certificate. You can use ACM or IAM to store and deploy server
  certificates. Use IAM as a certificate manager only when you must support HTTPS
  connections in a region that is not supported by ACM. IAM securely encrypts your
  private keys and stores the encrypted version in IAM SSL certificate storage. IAM
  supports deploying server certificates in all regions, but you must obtain your
  certificate from an external provider for use with AWS. You cannot upload an ACM
  certificate to IAM. Additionally, you cannot manage your certificates from the IAM
  Console.
