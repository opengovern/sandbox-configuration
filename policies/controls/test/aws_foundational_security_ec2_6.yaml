Title: 6 VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs
Description: This control checks whether Amazon VPC Flow Logs are found and enabled
  for VPCs. The traffic type is set to Reject. With the VPC Flow Logs feature, you
  can capture information about the IP address traffic going to and from network interfaces
  in your VPC. After you create a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in
  CloudWatch Logs. To reduce cost, you can also send your flow logs to Amazon S3.
