Title: 4 CloudFront distributions should have origin failover configured
Description: This control checks whether an Amazon CloudFront distribution is configured with an origin group that has two or more origins. CloudFront origin failover can increase availability. Origin failover automatically redirects traffic to a secondary origin if the primary origin is unavailable or if it returns specific HTTP response status codes.
