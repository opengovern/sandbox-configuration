ID: aws_secretsmanager_secret_rotated_as_scheduled
Title: Secrets Manager secrets should be rotated as per the rotation schedule
Description: This rule ensures that AWS Secrets Manager secrets have rotated successfully according to the rotation schedule. Rotating secrets on a regular schedule can shorten the period that a secret is active, and potentially reduce the business impact if it is compromised.
