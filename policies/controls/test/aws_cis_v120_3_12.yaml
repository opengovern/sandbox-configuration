Title: 3.12 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes to network gateways
Description: Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail
  Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.
  Network gateways are required to send/receive traffic to a destination outside of
  a VPC. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes
  to network gateways.
