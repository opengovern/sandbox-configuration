Title: 3.4 Ensure CloudTrail trails are integrated with CloudWatch Logs
Description: AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls made in a
  given AWS account. The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller,
  the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters,
  and the response elements returned by the AWS service. CloudTrail uses Amazon S3
  for log file storage and delivery, so log files are stored durably. In addition
  to capturing CloudTrail logs within a specified S3 bucket for long term analysis,
  realtime analysis can be performed by configuring CloudTrail to send logs to CloudWatch
  Logs. For a trail that is enabled in all regions in an account, CloudTrail sends
  log files from all those regions to a CloudWatch Logs log group. It is recommended
  that CloudTrail logs be sent to CloudWatch Logs.
