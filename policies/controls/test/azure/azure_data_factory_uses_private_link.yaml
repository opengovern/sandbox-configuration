Title: Azure Data Factory should use private link
Description: Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure Data Factory, data leakage risks are reduced.
