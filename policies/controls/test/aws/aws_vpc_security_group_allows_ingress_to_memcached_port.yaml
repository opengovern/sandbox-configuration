Title: VPC security groups should restrict ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to memcached port 11211
Description: This control checks whether the VPC security groups that are in use allow allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to memcached port 11211. Optionally the rule checks whether the port numbers are listed in the authorizedTcpPorts parameter. This control passes when none of the rules in a security group allow ingress traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 from port 11211.
