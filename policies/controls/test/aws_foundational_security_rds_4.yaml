Title: 4 RDS cluster snapshots and database snapshots should be encrypted at rest
Description: This control checks whether RDS DB snapshots are encrypted. This control is intended for RDS DB instances. However, it can also generate findings for snapshots of Aurora DB instances, Neptune DB instances, and Amazon DocumentDB clusters. If these findings are not useful, then you can suppress them.
