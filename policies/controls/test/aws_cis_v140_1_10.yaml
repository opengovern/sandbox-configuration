Title: 1.10 Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users
  that have a console password
Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of authentication
  assurance beyond traditional credentials. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in
  to the AWS Console, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well
  as for an authentication code from their physical or virtual MFA token. It is recommended
  that MFA be enabled for all accounts that have a console password.
