Title: 1.2 Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users that
  have a console password
Description: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection on
  top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS
  website, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an
  authentication code from their AWS MFA device. It is recommended that MFA be enabled
  for all accounts that have a console password.
