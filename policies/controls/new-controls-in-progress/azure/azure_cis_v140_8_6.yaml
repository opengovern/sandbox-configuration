Title: 8.6 Ensure the key vault is recoverable
Description: "The key vault contains object keys, secrets and certificates. Accidental unavailability of a key vault can cause immediate data loss or loss of security functions (authentication, validation, verification, non-repudiation, etc.) supported by the key vault objects. It is recommended the key vault be made recoverable by enabling the \\\"Do Not Purge\\\" and \\\"Soft Delete\\\" functions."
