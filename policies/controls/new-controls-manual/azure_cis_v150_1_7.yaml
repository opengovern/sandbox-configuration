Title: 1.7 Ensure that a Custom Bad Password List is set to 'Enforce' for your Organization
Description: Microsoft Azure creates a default bad password policy that is already applied to Azure administrative and normal user accounts. This is not applied to user accounts that are synced from an on-premise Active Directory unless Azure AD Connect is used and you enable EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers. Please see the list in default values on the specifics of this policy.
