Title: 4.5.3 Use Entra ID Client Authentication and Azure RBAC where possible
Description: Cosmos DB can use tokens or AAD for client authentication which in turn will use Azure RBAC for authorization. Using AAD is significantly more secure because AAD handles the credentials and allows for MFA and centralized management, and the Azure RBAC better integrated with the rest of Azure.
