Title: 8.2.5.a For a sample of system components, obtain and inspect system configuration settings to verify that password parameters are set to require that new passwords/passphrases cannot be the same as the four previously used passwords/passphrases
SectionCode: a
Description: "If password history isn't maintained, the effectiveness of changing passwords is reduced, as previous passwords can be reused over and over. Requiring that passwords cannot be reused for a period of time reduces the likelihood that passwords that have been guessed or brute-forced will be used in the future. Note: Testing Procedure 8.2.5.b is an additional procedure that only applies if the entity being assessed is a service provider."
