Title: 1.3.5 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that the firewall permits only established connections into the internal network and denies any inbound connections not associated with a previously established session
SectionCode: "5"
Description: A firewall that maintains the `state` (or the status) for each connection through the firewall knows whether an apparent response to a previous connection is actually a valid, authorized response (since it retains each connection's status) or is malicious traffic trying to trick the firewall into allowing the connection.
