Title: 8.6.c Examine system configuration settings and/or physical controls, as applicable, to verify that controls are implemented to ensure only the intended account can use that mechanism to gain access
SectionCode: c
Description: If user authentication mechanisms such as tokens, smart cards, and certificates can be used by multiple accounts, it may be impossible to identify the individual using the authentication mechanism. Having physical and/or logical controls (for example, a PIN, biometric data, or a password) to uniquely identify the user of the account will prevent unauthorized users from gaining access through use of a shared authentication mechanism.
