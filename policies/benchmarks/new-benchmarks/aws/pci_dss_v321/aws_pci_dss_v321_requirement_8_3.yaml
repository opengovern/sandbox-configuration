Title: 8.3 Secure all individual non-console administrative access and all remote access to the CDE using multi-factor authentication
SectionCode: "3"
Description: "Note: Multi-factor authentication requires that a minimum of two of the three authentication methods (see Requirement 8.2 for descriptions of authentication methods) be used for authentication. Using one factor twice (for example, using two separate passwords) is not considered multi-factor authentication. Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication (as described in Requirement 8.2), before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk. Multi-factor authentication is not required at both the system-level and application-level for a particular system component. Multi-factor authentication can be performed either upon authentication to the particular network or to the system component. Examples of multi-factor technologies include but are not limited to remote authentication and dial-in service (RADIUS) with tokens; terminal access controller access control system (TACACS) with tokens; and other technologies that facilitate multi- factor authentication."
