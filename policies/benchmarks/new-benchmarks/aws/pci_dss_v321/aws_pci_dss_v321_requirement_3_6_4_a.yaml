Title: 3.6.4.a Verify that key-management procedures include a defined cryptoperiod for each key type in use and define a process for key changes at the end of the defined cryptoperiod(s)
SectionCode: a
Description: A cryptoperiod is the time span during which a particular cryptographic key can be used for its defined purpose. Considerations for defining the cryptoperiod include, but are not limited to, the strength of the underlying algorithm, size or length of the key, risk of key compromise, and the sensitivity of the data being encrypted. Periodic changing of encryption keys when the keys have reached the end of their cryptoperiod is imperative to minimize the risk of someone’s obtaining the encryption keys, and using them to decrypt data.
