Title: 3.4.1.a If disk encryption is used, inspect the configuration and observe the authentication process to verify that logical access to encrypted file systems is implemented via a mechanism that is separate from the native operating system's authentication mechanism (for example, not using local user account databases or general network login credentials)
SectionCode: a
Description: "The intent of this requirement is to address the acceptability of disk-level encryption for rendering cardholder data unreadable. Disk-level encryption encrypts the entire disk/partition on a computer and automatically decrypts the information when an authorized user requests it. Many disk- encryption solutions intercept operating system read/write operations and carry out the appropriate cryptographic transformations without any special action by the user other than supplying a password or pass phrase upon system startup or at the beginning of a session. Based on these characteristics of disk-level encryption, to be compliant with this requirement, the method cannot: 1) Use the same user account authenticator as the operating system, or 2) Use a decryption key that is associated with or derived from the system's local user account database or general network login credentials. Full disk encryption helps to protect data in the event of physical loss of a disk and therefore may be appropriate for portable devices that store cardholder data."
