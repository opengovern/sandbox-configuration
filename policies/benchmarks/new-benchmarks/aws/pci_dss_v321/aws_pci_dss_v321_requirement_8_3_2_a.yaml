Title: 8.3.2.a Examine system configurations for remote access servers and systems to verify multi-factor authentication is required for all remote access by personnel, both user and administrator, and all third-party/vendor remote access (including access to applications and system components for support or maintenance purposes)
SectionCode: a
Description: This requirement is intended to apply to all personnel—including general users, administrators, and vendors (for support or maintenance) with remote access to the network—where that remote access could lead to access to the CDE. If remote access is to an entity's network that has appropriate segmentation, such that remote users cannot access or impact the cardholder data environment, multi-factor authentication for remote access to that network would not be required. However, multi- factor authentication is required for any remote access to networks with access to the cardholder data environment, and is recommended for all remote access to the entity's networks.
