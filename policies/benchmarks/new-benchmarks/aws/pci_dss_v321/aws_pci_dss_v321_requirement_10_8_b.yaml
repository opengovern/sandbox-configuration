Title: 10.8.b Examine detection and alerting processes and interview personnel to verify that processes are implemented for all critical security controls
SectionCode: b
Description: "The failure of a critical security control results in the generation of an alert.10.8.b Examine detection and alerting processes and interview personnel to verify that processes are implemented for all critical security controls, and that failure of a critical security control results in the generation of an alert. Note: This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider. Without formal processes to detect and alert when critical security controls fail, failures may go undetected for extended periods and provide attackers ample time to compromise systems and steal sensitive data from the cardholder data environment. The specific types of failures may vary depending on the function of the device and technology in use. Typical failures include a system ceasing to perform its security function or not functioning in its intended manner; for example, a firewall erasing all its rules or going offline."
