Title: "1.a Examine the data retention and disposal policies, procedures and processes
  to verify they satisfy all the requirements for cardholder data (CHD) storage"
Description: "procedures and processes should they include the following for all
  cardholder data (CHD) storage: limiting data storage amount and retention time to
  that which is required for legal, regulatory, and/or business requirements, specific
  requirements for retention of cardholder data (for example, cardholder data needs
  to be held for X period for Y business reasons), processes for secure deletion of
  cardholder data when no longer needed for legal, regulatory, or business reasons
  and a quarterly process for identifying and securely deleting stored cardholder
  data that exceeds defined retention requirements. Identifying and deleting stored
  data that has exceeded its specified retention period prevents unnecessary retention
  of data that is no longer needed. This process may be automated or manual or a combination
  of both. For example, a programmatic procedure (automatic or manual) to locate and
  remove data and/or a manual review of data storage areas could be performed. Implementing
  secure deletion methods ensure that the data cannot be retrieved when it is no longer
  needed. Remember, if you don''''''''t need it, don''''''''t store it!"
