Title: "6.4 Cryptographic key changes for keys that have reached the end of their
  cryptoperiod (for example, after a defined period of time has passed and/or after
  a certain amount of cipher-text has been produced by a given key), as defined by
  the associated application vendor or key owner, and based on industry best practices
  and guidelines"
Description: "A cryptoperiod is the time span during which a particular cryptographic
  key can be used for its defined purpose. Considerations for defining the cryptoperiod
  include, but are not limited to, the strength of the underlying algorithm, size
  or length of the key, risk of key compromise, and the sensitivity of the data being
  encrypted. Periodic changing of encryption keys when the keys have reached the end
  of their cryptoperiod is imperative to minimize the risk of someone''''''''s obtaining
  the encryption keys, and using them to decrypt data."
