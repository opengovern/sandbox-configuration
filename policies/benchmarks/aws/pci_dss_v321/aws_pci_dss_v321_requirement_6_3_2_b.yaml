Title: "3.2.b Select a sample of recent custom application changes and verify that
  custom application code is reviewed according to 6.3.2.a, above"
Description: "Security vulnerabilities in custom code are commonly exploited by malicious
  individuals to gain access to a network and compromise cardholder data. An individual
  knowledgeable and experienced in code-review techniques should be involved in the
  review process. Code reviews should be performed by someone other than the developer
  of the code to allow for an independent, objective review. Automated tools or processes
  may also be used in lieu of manual reviews, but keep in mind that it may be difficult
  or even impossible for an automated tool to identify some coding issues. Correcting
  coding errors before the code is deployed into a production environment or released
  to customers prevents the code exposing the environments to potential exploit. Faulty
  code is also far more difficult and expensive to address after it has been deployed
  or released into production environments. Including a formal review and signoff
  by management prior to release helps to ensure that code is approved and has been
  developed in accordance with policies and procedures."
