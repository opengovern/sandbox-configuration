title: Managed disks should be double encrypted with both platform-managed and customer-managed keys
description: High security sensitive customers who are concerned of the risk associated with any particular encryption algorithm, implementation, or key being compromised can opt for additional layer of encryption using a different encryption algorithm/mode at the infrastructure layer using platform managed encryption keys. The disk encryption sets are required to use double encryption.
