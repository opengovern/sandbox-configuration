title: Ensure 'Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account' is Enabled for Storage Account Access
description: Some Azure services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that can't be granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Azure services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account.
