title: VPC security groups should restrict ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to cassandra ports 7199 or 9160 or 8888
description: This control checks whether the VPC security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to cassandra ports 7199 or 9160 or 8888. This control passes when none of the rules in a security group allow ingress traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 from ports 7199 or 9160 or 8888.
