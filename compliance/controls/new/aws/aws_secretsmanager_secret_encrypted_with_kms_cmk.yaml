title: Secrets Manager secrets should be encrypted using CMK
description: Ensure that all secrets in AWS Secrets Manager are encrypted using the AWS managed key (aws/secretsmanager) or a customer managed key that was created in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The rule is compliant if a secret is encrypted using a customer managed key. This rule is non-compliant if a secret is encrypted using aws/secretsmanager.
