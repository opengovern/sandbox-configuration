title: RDS Aurora clusters should have backtracking enabled
description: This control checks whether AWS Aurora clusters have backtracking enabled. Backups help you to recover more quickly from a security incident. They also strengthen the resilience of your systems. Aurora backtracking reduces the time to recover a database to a point in time. It does not require a database restore to so.
