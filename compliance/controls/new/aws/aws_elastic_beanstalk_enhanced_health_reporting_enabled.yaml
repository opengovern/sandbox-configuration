description: AWS Elastic Beanstalk enhanced health reporting enables a more rapid response to changes in the health of the underlying infrastructure. These changes could result in a lack of availability of the application. Elastic Beanstalk enhanced health reporting provides a status descriptor to gauge the severity of the identified issues and identify possible causes to investigate.
