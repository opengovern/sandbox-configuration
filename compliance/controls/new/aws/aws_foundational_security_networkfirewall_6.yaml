title: 6 Stateless network firewall rule group should not be empty
description: A rule group contains rules that define how your firewall processes traffic in your VPC. An empty stateless rule group when present in a firewall policy might give the impression that the rule group will process traffic. However, when the stateless rule group is empty, it does not process traffic.
