title: 4 Ensure CloudTrail log file validation is enabled
description: This control checks whether log file integrity validation is enabled on a CloudTrail trail. CloudTrail log file validation creates a digitally signed digest file that contains a hash of each log that CloudTrail writes to Amazon S3. You can use these digest files to determine whether a log file was changed, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered the log.
