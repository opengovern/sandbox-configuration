title: 2 EKS clusters should run on a supported Kubernetes version
description: This control checks whether an Amazon EKS cluster is running on a supported Kubernetes version. The control fails if the EKS cluster is running on an unsupported version. If your application doesn't require a specific version of Kubernetes, we recommend that you use the latest available Kubernetes version that's supported by EKS for your clusters.
