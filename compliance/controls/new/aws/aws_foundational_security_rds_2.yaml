title: 2 RDS DB instances should prohibit public access, determined by the PubliclyAccessible configuration
description: This control checks whether Amazon RDS instances are publicly accessible by evaluating the PubliclyAccessible field in the instance configuration item. Neptune DB instances and Amazon DocumentDB clusters do not have the PubliclyAccessible flag and cannot be evaluated. However, this control can still generate findings for these resources. You can suppress these findings.
