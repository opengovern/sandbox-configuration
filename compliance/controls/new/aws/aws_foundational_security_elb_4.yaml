title: 4 Application load balancers should be configured to drop HTTP headers
description: This control evaluates AWS Application Load Balancers (ALB) to ensure they are configured to drop invalid HTTP headers. The control fails if the value of routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled is set to false. By default, ALBs are not configured to drop invalid HTTP header values. Removing these header values prevents HTTP desync attacks.
