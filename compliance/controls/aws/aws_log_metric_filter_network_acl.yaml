Description: You can do real-time monitoring of API calls by directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. NACLs are used as a stateless packet filter to control ingress and egress traffic for subnets in a VPC. Security Hub recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for changes to NACLs. Monitoring these changes helps ensure that AWS resources and services aren't unintentionally exposed.
