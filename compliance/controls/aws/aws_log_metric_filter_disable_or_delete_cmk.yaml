Description: You can do real-time monitoring of API calls by directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. Security Hub recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for customer managed keys that have changed state to disabled or scheduled deletion. Data encrypted with disabled or deleted keys is no longer accessible.
