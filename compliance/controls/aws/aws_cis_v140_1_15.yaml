title: 1.15 Ensure IAM Users Receive Permissions Only Through Groups
description: 'IAM users are granted access to services, functions, and data through IAM policies. There are three ways to define policies for a user: 1) Edit the user policy directly, aka an inline, or user, policy; 2) attach a policy directly to a user; 3) add the user to an IAM group that has an attached policy. Only the third implementation is recommended.'
