title: 3.12 Change the auto-generated password for Windows based instances
description: When you create a Windows Server-based instance, Lightsail randomly generates a long password that is hard to guess. You use this password uniquely with your new instance. You can use the default password to connect quickly to your instance using remote desktop (RDP). You are always logged in as the Administrator on your Lightsail instance.
