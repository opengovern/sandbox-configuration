title: 5 RDS DB instances should be configured with multiple Availability Zones
description: This control checks whether high availability is enabled for your RDS DB instances. RDS DB instances should be configured for multiple Availability Zones (AZs). This ensures the availability of the data stored. Multi-AZ deployments allow for automated failover if there is an issue with Availability Zone availability and during regular RDS maintenance.
