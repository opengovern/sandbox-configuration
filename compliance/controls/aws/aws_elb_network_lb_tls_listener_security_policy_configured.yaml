title: ELB network load balancers should have TLS listener security policy configured
description: Ensure that your Network Load Balancers (NLBs) are configured with a TLS listener security policy. Using insecure ciphers for your NLB Predefined or Custom Security Policy could make the TLS connection between the client and the load balancer vulnerable to exploits.
