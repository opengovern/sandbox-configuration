title: CloudFormation stacks outputs should not have any secrets
description: Ensure CloudFormation stacks outputs do not contain secrets like user names, passwords, and tokens. It is recommended to remove secrets since outputs cannot be encrypted resulting in any entity with basic read-metadata-only and access to CloudFormation outputs having access to these secrets.
