Description: Ensure classic load balancers have at least one outbound rule in all the attached security groups. A security group without any outbound rule rejects all outgoing traffic. This means that all outgoing traffic originating from your cloud assets (instances, containers, etc.) will be dropped when it reaches the ELB layer.
