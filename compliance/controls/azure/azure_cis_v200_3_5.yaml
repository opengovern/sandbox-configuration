title: 3.5 Ensure Storage Logging is Enabled for Queue Service for 'Read', 'Write', and 'Delete' requests
description: The Storage Queue service stores messages that may be read by any client who has access to the storage account. A queue can contain an unlimited number of messages, each of which can be up to 64KB in size using version 2011-08-18 or newer. Storage Logging happens server-side and allows details for both successful and failed requests to be recorded in the storage account.
