title: 3.4 Ensure that shared access signature tokens expire within an hour
description: A shared access signature (SAS) is a URI that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources. A shared access signature can be provided to clients who should not be trusted with the storage account key but for whom it may be necessary to delegate access to certain storage account resources. Providing a shared access signature URI to these clients allows them access to a resource for a specified period of time. This time should be set as low as possible and preferably no longer than an hour.
