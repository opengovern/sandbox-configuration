Description: Azure App Service authentication is a feature that can prevent anonymous HTTP requests from reaching a Web Application or authenticate those with tokens before they reach the app. If an anonymous request is received from a browser, App Service will redirect to a logon page. To handle the logon process, a choice from a set of identity providers can be made, or a custom authentication mechanism can be implemented.
