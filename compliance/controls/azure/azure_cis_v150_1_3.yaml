title: 1.3 Ensure Access Review is Set Up for External Users in Azure AD Privileged Identity Management
description: This recommendation extends guest access review by utilizing the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management feature provided in Azure AD Premium P2. Azure AD is extended to include Azure AD B2B collaboration, allowing you to invite people from outside your organization to be guest users in your cloud account and sign in with their own work, school, or social identities. Guest users allow you to share your company's applications and services with users from any other organization, while maintaining control over your own corporate data. Work with external partners, large or small, even if they don't have Azure AD or an IT department. A simple invitation and redemption process lets partners use their own credentials to access your company's resources as a guest user.
