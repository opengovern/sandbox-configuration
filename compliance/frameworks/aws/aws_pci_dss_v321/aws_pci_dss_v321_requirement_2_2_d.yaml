Title: 2.d Verify that system configuration standards include the procedures like changing of all vendor-supplied defaults and elimination of unnecessary default accounts etc. for all types of system components
Description: 'System configuration standards include the following procedures for all types of system components: changing of all vendor-supplied defaults and elimination of unnecessary default accounts, implementing only one primary function per server to prevent functions that require different security levels from co-existing on the same server, enabling only necessary services, protocols, daemons, etc., as required for the function of the system, implementing additional security features for any required services, protocols or daemons that are considered to be insecure, configuring system security parameters to prevent misuse and removing all unnecessary functionality, such as scripts, drivers, features, subsystems, file systems, and unnecessary web servers. There are known weaknesses with many operating systems, databases, and enterprise applications, and there are also known ways to configure these systems to fix security vulnerabilities. To help those that are not security experts, a number of security organizations have established system-hardening guidelines and recommendations, which advise how to correct these weaknesses. Examples of sources for guidance on configuration standards include, but are not limited to: www.nist.gov, www.sans.org, and www.cisecurity.org, www.iso.org, and product vendors. System configuration standards must be kept up to date to ensure that newly identified weaknesses are corrected prior to a system being installed on the network.'
