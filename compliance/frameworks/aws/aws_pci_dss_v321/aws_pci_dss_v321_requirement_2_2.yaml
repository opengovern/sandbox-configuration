Title: Develop configuration standards for all system components
Description: 'Assure that these standards address all known security vulnerabilities and are consistent with industry-accepted system hardening standards. Sources of industry-accepted system hardening standards may include, but are not limited to Center for Internet Security (CIS), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), SysAdmin Audit Network Security (SANS) Institute and National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST). There are known weaknesses with many operating systems, databases, and enterprise applications, and there are also known ways to configure these systems to fix security vulnerabilities. To help those that are not security experts, a number of security organizations have established system-hardening guidelines and recommendations, which advise how to correct these weaknesses. Examples of sources for guidance on configuration standards include, but are not limited to: www.nist.gov, www.sans.org, and www.cisecurity.org, www.iso.org, and product vendors. System configuration standards must be kept up to date to ensure that newly identified weaknesses are corrected prior to a system being installed on the network.'
