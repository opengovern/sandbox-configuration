Title: 4.b Examine system configurations and interview responsible personnel to confirm intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques alert personnel of suspected compromises
Description: Intrusion detection and/or intrusion prevention techniques (such as IDS/IPS) compare the traffic coming into the network with known “signatures” and/or behaviors of thousands of compromise types (hacker tools, Trojans, and other malware), and send alerts and/or stop the attempt as it happens. Without a proactive approach to unauthorized activity detection, attacks on (or misuse of) computer resources could go unnoticed in real time. Security alerts generated by these techniques should be monitored so that the attempted intrusions can be stopped.
