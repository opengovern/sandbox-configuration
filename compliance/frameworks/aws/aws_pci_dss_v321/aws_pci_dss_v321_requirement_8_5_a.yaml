Title: 5.a For a sample of system components, examine user ID lists to verify that generic user IDs are disabled or removed, shared user IDs for system administration activities and other critical functions do not exist or are shared, and generic user IDs are not used to administer any system components
Description: Generic user IDs are disabled or removed.  Shared user IDs for system administration activities and other critical functions do not exist.  Shared and generic user IDs are not used to administer any system components. If multiple users share the same authentication credentials (for example, user account and password), it becomes impossible to trace system access and activities to an individual. This in turn prevents an entity from assigning accountability for, or having effective logging of, an individual's actions, since a given action could have been performed by anyone in the group that has knowledge of the authentication credentials.
