Title: 3.2 Incorporate multi-factor authentication for all remote network access (both user and administrator, and including third-party access for support or maintenance) originating from outside the entity's network
Description: This requirement is intended to apply to all personnel—including general users, administrators, and vendors (for support or maintenance) with remote access to the network—where that remote access could lead to access to the CDE. If remote access is to an entity's network that has appropriate segmentation, such that remote users cannot access or impact the cardholder data environment, multi-factor authentication for remote access to that network would not be required. However, multi- factor authentication is required for any remote access to networks with access to the cardholder data environment, and is recommended for all remote access to the entity's networks.
