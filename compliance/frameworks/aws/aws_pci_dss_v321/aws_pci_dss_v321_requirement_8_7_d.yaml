Title: 7.d Examine database access control settings, database application configuration settings, and the related application IDs to verify that application IDs can only be used by the applications (and not by individual users or other processes)
Description: Without user authentication for access to databases and applications, the potential for unauthorized or malicious access increases, and such access cannot be logged since the user has not been authenticated and is therefore not known to the system. Also, database access should be granted through programmatic methods only (for example, through stored procedures), rather than via direct access to the database by end users (except for DBAs, who may need direct access to the database for their administrative duties).
