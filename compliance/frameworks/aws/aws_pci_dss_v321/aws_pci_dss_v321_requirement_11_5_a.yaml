Title: 5.a Verify the use of a change-detection mechanism by observing system settings and monitored files, as well as reviewing results from monitoring activities
Description: Examples of files that should be monitored are system executables, application executables, configuration and parameter files, centrally stored, historical or archived, log and audit files and additional critical files determined by entity (for example, through risk assessment or other means). Change-detection solutions such as file-integrity monitoring (FIM) tools check for changes, additions, and deletions to critical files, and notify when such changes are detected. If not implemented properly and the output of the change-detection solution monitored, a malicious individual could add, remove, or alter configuration file contents, operating system programs, or application executables. Unauthorized changes, if undetected, could render existing security controls ineffective and/or result in cardholder data being stolen with no perceptible impact to normal processing.
