Title: 2.4 Invalid logical access attempts
Description: Malicious users often attempt to alter audit logs to hide their actions, and a record of access allows an organization to trace any inconsistencies or potential tampering of the logs to an individual account. Having access to logs identifying changes, additions, and deletions can help retrace steps made by unauthorized personnel. This control verifies access to all audit trails is logged.
