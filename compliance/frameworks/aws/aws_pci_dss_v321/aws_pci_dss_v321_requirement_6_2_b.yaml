Title: 2.b For a sample of system components and related software, compare the list of security patches installed on each system to the most recent vendor security-patch list, to verify that the applicable critical vendor-supplied security patches are installed within one month of release, all applicable vendor-supplied security patches are installed within an appropriate time frame (for example, within three months)
Description: There is a constant stream of attacks using widely published exploits, often called `zero day` (an attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability), against otherwise secured systems. If the most recent patches are not implemented on critical systems as soon as possible, a malicious individual can use these exploits to attack or disable a system, or gain access to sensitive data. Prioritizing patches for critical infrastructure ensures that high-priority systems and devices are protected from vulnerabilities as soon as possible after a patch is released. Consider prioritizing patch installations such that security patches for critical or at-risk systems are installed within 30 days, and other lower-risk patches are installed within 2-3 months. This requirement applies to applicable patches for all installed software, including payment applications (both those that are PA-DSS validated and those that are not).
