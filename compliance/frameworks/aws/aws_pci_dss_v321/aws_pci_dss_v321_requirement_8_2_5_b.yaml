Title: 2.5.b Additional testing procedure for service provider assessments only to review internal processes and customer/user documentation to verify that new non-consumer customer user passwords/passphrase cannot be the same as the previous four passwords
Description: 'If password history isn''t maintained, the effectiveness of changing passwords is reduced, as previous passwords can be reused over and over. Requiring that passwords cannot be reused for a period of time reduces the likelihood that passwords that have been guessed or brute-forced will be used in the future. Note: Testing Procedure 8.2.5.b is an additional procedure that only applies if the entity being assessed is a service provider.'
