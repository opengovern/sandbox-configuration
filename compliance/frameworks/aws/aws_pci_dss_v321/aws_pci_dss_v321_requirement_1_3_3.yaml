Title: 3.3 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that anti-spoofing measures are implemented, for example internal addresses cannot pass from the Internet into the DMZ
Description: Normally a packet contains the IP address of the computer that originally sent it so other computers in the network know where the packet came from. Malicious individuals will often try to spoof (or imitate) the sending IP address so that the target system believes the packet is from a trusted source. Filtering packets coming into the network helps to, among other things, ensure packets are not “spoofed” to look like they are coming from an organization's own internal network.
