Title: 2.5 Remove all unnecessary functionality, such as scripts, drivers, features, subsystems, file systems, and unnecessary web servers
Description: Unnecessary functions can provide additional opportunities for malicious individuals to gain access to a system. By removing unnecessary functionality, organizations can focus on securing the functions that are required and reduce the risk that unknown functions will be exploited. Including this in server-hardening standards and processes addresses the specific security implications associated with unnecessary functions (for example, by removing/disabling FTP or the web server if the server will not be performing those functions).
