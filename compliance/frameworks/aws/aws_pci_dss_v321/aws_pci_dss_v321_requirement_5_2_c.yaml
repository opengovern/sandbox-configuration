Title: 2.c Examine a sample of system components, including all operating system types commonly affected by malicious software, to verify that the anti-virus software and definitions are current and periodic scans are performed
Description: Even the best anti-virus solutions are limited in effectiveness if they are not maintained and kept current with the latest security updates, signature files, or malware protections. Audit logs provide the ability to monitor virus and malware activity and anti-malware reactions. Thus, it is imperative that anti-malware solutions be configured to generate audit logs and that these logs be managed in accordance with Requirement 10.
