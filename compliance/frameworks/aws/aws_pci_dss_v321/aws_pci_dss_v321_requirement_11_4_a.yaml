Title: 4.a Examine system configurations and network diagrams to verify that techniques (such as intrusion-detection systems and/or intrusion-prevention systems) are in place to monitor all traffic at the perimeter of the cardholder data environment and at critical points in the cardholder data environment
Description: Intrusion detection and/or intrusion prevention techniques (such as IDS/IPS) compare the traffic coming into the network with known “signatures” and/or behaviors of thousands of compromise types (hacker tools, Trojans, and other malware), and send alerts and/or stop the attempt as it happens. Without a proactive approach to unauthorized activity detection, attacks on (or misuse of) computer resources could go unnoticed in real time. Security alerts generated by these techniques should be monitored so that the attempted intrusions can be stopped.
