Title: 3.1.a Examine network and/or system configurations, as applicable, to verify multi-factor authentication is required for all non-console administrative access into the CDE
Description: This requirement is intended to apply to all personnel with administrative access to the CDE. This requirement applies only to personnel with administrative access and only for non-console access to the CDE; it does not apply to application or system accounts performing automated functions. If the entity does not use segmentation to separate the CDE from the rest of their network, an administrator could use multi-factor authentication either when logging onto the CDE network or when logging onto a system. If the CDE is segmented from the rest of the entity's network, an administrator would need to use multi- factor authentication when connecting to a CDE system from a non-CDE network. Multi-factor authentication can be implemented at network level or at system/application level; it does not have to be both. If the administrator uses MFA when logging into the CDE network, they do not also need to use MFA to log into a particular system or application within the CDE.
